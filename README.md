The wife used her phone to generate an app she wants for personal use.
She has the code from her phone, but I am making it function.
This is the demo project I am using to get more familiar with the Programing language.
This project can be found here: https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-codelab-first#0

I have this posted to share with my I.C.Stars KC Cycle 3 cohorts.

If you would like to see the end results, you simply need to replace the files in the project.
